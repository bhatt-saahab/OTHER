# Guide for Setting Up and Flashing an ESP32-Based Network Tool

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for configuring an ESP32 (or ESP32-C5 for 5 GHz support) to flash firmware files using a mobile application, connect to a network, and configure settings via a web interface. The process includes hardware setup, firmware flashing, and network configuration for a controlled, authorized environment.

## Requirements
- **Hardware**:
  - ESP32 module (for 2.4 GHz) or ESP32-C5 module (for 5 GHz support).
  - 3.7V battery or 5V phone charger (output 2–4W, avoid fast chargers above 5V).
  - USB cable for flashing (compatible with ESP32 and phone).
  - Phone (iOS or Android) for flashing and configuration.
- **Software**:
  - Mobile app: `ESP32_Flash` (custom or third-party flashing tool).
  - Firmware files (download from provided link: [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15hB0NvEOLbNipAn-T77PZo7VzJDnDqmD)):
    - `partition-table_01.bin`
    - `bootloader_02.bin`
    - `esp32-wifi-penetration-tool_03.bin`
- **Tools**:
  - Web browser (for configuration).
  - WiFi-enabled device (phone, laptop, etc.) for network setup.

## Safety and Compliance
- Use only a 5V power source (e.g., standard phone charger) to avoid damaging the ESP32.
- Connect the red wire to VIN and the black wire to GND.
- Ensure all activities comply with local laws and regulations. Unauthorized network disruption is illegal.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Hardware Setup
1. **Power Connection**:
   - Connect the ESP32 to a 3.7V battery or a 5V phone charger (2–4W output).
   - Wiring:
     - Red wire: Connect to VIN pin on ESP32.
     - Black wire: Connect to GND pin on ESP32.
   - **Warning**: Avoid fast chargers or power sources exceeding 5V to prevent damage.
2. **USB Connection**:
   - Connect the ESP32 to your phone using a compatible USB cable for flashing.

### 2. Flashing Firmware
1. **Install the Flashing App**:
   - Download and install the `ESP32_Flash` app on your phone (iOS or Android).
   - Ensure the app is configured to communicate with the ESP32 via USB.
2. **Download Firmware Files**:
   - Access the provided link: [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15hB0NvEOLbNipAn-T77PZo7VzJDnDqmD).
   - Download the following files:
     - `partition-table_01.bin`
     - `bootloader_02.bin`
     - `esp32-wifi-penetration-tool_03.bin`
3. **Flash the Firmware**:
   - Open the `ESP32_Flash` app. The interface will display options for selecting firmware files.
   - Assign files to the appropriate slots:
     - **First File**: Select `partition-table_01.bin` and set the offset to `0x8000`.
     - **Second File**: Select `bootloader_02.bin` and set the offset to `0x1000`.
     - **Third File**: Select `esp32-wifi-penetration-tool_03.bin` and set the offset to `0x10000`.
   - Click the **Flash** button to begin the flashing process.
   - Monitor the status at the bottom of the app:
     - **Success**: If flashing is successful, the app will display a message indicating you can unplug the device.
     - **Failure**: If flashing fails, retry the process with the same settings and check cable connections.
4. **Unplug the Device**:
   - Once flashing is complete and the app confirms success, safely disconnect the ESP32 from the phone.

### 3. Network Configuration
1. **Connect to the ESP32’s WiFi**:
   - On your phone or another WiFi-enabled device, enable WiFi and scan for networks.
   - Connect to the ESP32’s network (default SSID may vary, e.g., “ESP32_AP”).
   - Enter the password: `mgmtadmin`.
2. **Access the Web Interface**:
   - Open a web browser on the connected device.
   - Navigate to the IP address: `192.168.4.1`.
   - The web interface will load, displaying configuration options.

### 4. Configuring the Tool
1. **Select Target**:
   - In the web interface, locate the **Attack Configuration** section.
   - Choose the target network or device (for authorized testing only).
2. **Set Attack Parameters** (for authorized testing in a controlled environment):
   - **Attack Type**: Select `ATTACK_TYPE_DOS` (for demonstration purposes in a legal, controlled setting).
   - **Attack Method**: Choose `DEAUTH_COMBINE_ALL`.
   - **Attack Timeout**: Set to `120` seconds.
3. **Initiate the Action**:
   - Click the **Attack** button to execute the configured action.
   - The tool will perform the specified task for 120 seconds, affecting only the target network in a controlled environment.
4. **Verify Operation**:
   - Ensure the target network behaves as expected during the test.
   - Stop the action after 120 seconds or manually if needed.

## Troubleshooting
- **Flashing Failure**:
  - Verify USB cable integrity and connections.
  - Ensure correct file offsets (`0x8000`, `0x1000`, `0x10000`).
  - Retry the flashing process.
- **WiFi Connection Issues**:
  - Confirm the correct password (`mgmtadmin`).
  - Ensure the ESP32 is powered and within WiFi range.
- **Web Interface Not Loading**:
  - Double-check the IP address (`192.168.4.1`).
  - Clear browser cache or try a different browser.

## Legal Disclaimer
- This guide is provided for educational purposes in controlled, authorized environments only.
- Unauthorized use of network disruption tools, such as WiFi jammers or deauthentication attacks, is illegal in most jurisdictions and may violate laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) or local equivalents.
- The user is solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
- Do not use this tool on public or unauthorized 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz networks.
